<p id="paragraph">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

	<p>To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom
heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she
eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that
he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions,
and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise
but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect
reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen,
but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position.
He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a
sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent
for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for
the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate
and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting
factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental
results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his
own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a
strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but
one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of
dubious and questionable memory.</p>
<p>I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us
away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the
home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first
finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient
to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every
form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our
lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating
from week to week between cocaine and ambition,
the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own
keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the
study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary
powers of observation in following out those clues,
and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as 
hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some
vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the
case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular
tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of
the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully
for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs
of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the
readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and
companion.</p>
<p> One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning
from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to
civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I
passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated
in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents
of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see
Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary
powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as
I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette
against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly,
eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands
clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and
habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at
work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and
was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell
and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in
part my own.</p>
